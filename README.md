##### Game of crystals.

#### Instructions:

* By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
* You win the game by matching your total score to random number
* Enjoy!




## Objective:

* Create a game that challenges the user to equal the given number by adding the value of the 4 gems provided. Each gem/crystal will have a random unknown value which will be added
    to the user number by each click.
* User will have to make his own calculation in order to equal his number to the given number. Given number is also a random number provided.


## Technical approach

1. Create the backbone html
2. Create provided random number and gems random numbers. Make sure they don't repeat between each others.
3. Create buttons and show all random numbers on screen
4. Create the functions to add values and dynamically show on screen on each click
5. Function in case user wins.
6. Restart the game using counters for each win/lose.
